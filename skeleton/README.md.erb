## Overview

*FIXME:* The text below is boilerplate copy.  Ensure that it is correct and remove this message!

A one-maybe-two sentence summary of what the module does/what problem it solves. This is your 30 second elevator pitch for your module. Consider including OS/Puppet version it works with.

## This is a SIMP module
This module is a component of the [https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/SIMP](System Integrity Management Platform), a managed security compliance framework built on Puppet.

_*FIXME: verify that the following paragraph fits this module's characteristics!*_

This module is optimally designed for use within a larger SIMP ecosystem, but it can be used independently:
* When included within the SIMP ecosystem, security compliance settings will be managed from the Puppet server.
* If used independently, all SIMP-managed security subsystems are disabled by default, and must be explicitly opted into by administrators.  Please review the `client_nets` and `$enable_*` parameters in `manifests/init.pp` for details.


## Module Description

*FIXME:* The text below is boilerplate copy.  Ensure that it is correct and remove this message!

If applicable, this section should have a brief description of the technology the module integrates with and what that integration enables. This section should answer the questions: "What does this module *do*?" and "Why would I use it?"

If your module has a range of functionality (installation, configuration, management, etc.) this is the time to mention it.

## Setup

### What <%= metadata.name %> affects

*FIXME:* The text below is boilerplate copy.  Ensure that it is correct and remove this message!

* A list of files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter, impact, or execute on the system it's installed on.
* This is a great place to stick any warnings.
* Can be in list or paragraph form.

### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**

*FIXME:* The text below is boilerplate copy.  Ensure that it is correct and remove this message!

If your module requires anything extra before setting up (pluginsync enabled, etc.), mention it here.

### Beginning with <%= metadata.name %>

The very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running.

If your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires particular steps for upgrading, you may wish to include an additional section here: Upgrading (For an example, see http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/firewall).

## Usage

*FIXME:* The text below is boilerplate copy.  Ensure that it is correct and remove this message!

Put the classes, types, and resources for customizing, configuring, and doing the fancy stuff with your module here.

## Reference

*FIXME:* The text below is boilerplate copy.  Ensure that it is correct and remove this message!

Here, list the classes, types, providers, facts, etc contained in your module. This section should include all of the under-the-hood workings of your module so people know what the module is touching on their system but don't need to mess with things. (We are working on automating this message!)

## Limitations

*FIXME:* The text below is boilerplate copy.  Ensure that it is correct and remove this message!

SIMP Puppet modules are generally intended to be used on a Redhat Enterprise Linux-compatible distribution such as EL6 and EL7.  A SIMP module should
